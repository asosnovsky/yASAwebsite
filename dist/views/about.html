Our purpose is to create a friendly and helpful community for all Mathematics for Commerce – Actuarial Stream students plus all Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, and other major students who are interested in entering the field of actuarial science in some time in their career. We provide a variety of events throughout the year, our highlight being the Actuarial Students National Association (ASNA) annual convention. </p> <h2>Benefits of Joining ASAYU</h2> <p class="indent enlarge"> Students who seek to take the actuarial path for their career should not hesitate to participate in the club. You will receive an incredible amount of information and knowledge needed to get prepared for the SOA’s exams, and Validation by Educational Experience (VEE). You can also find out what certain Math courses offered at York will help you towards the preparation of the exams and obtaining the VEE. The club, with the help of Club Infinity (Undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics Club @ York), will provide you with past exams of the most of the Math courses offered at York for your maximum academic results. You can also connect with other actuarial or Math students to buy and sell textbooks. ASAYU will also create study groups for preparing for the exams and also for certain Math courses offered at York. The list goes on and on... </p> <p class="indent enlarge"> But the best part of joining ASAYU is to enjoy your success at York and in the future. Math and statistics can be dreadful, and if we work together, as a team with the same visions and ambitions, the University experience will be more rewarding, and the network you’ve made within the club with other students will assist you in your future. </p> </section> </div> <!-- Sidebar --> <div id="sidebar" class="col-md-3"> <div class="row"> <h2>Links:</h2> </div> <div class="row sidebar-box"> <a href="https://www.soa.org/"> <img src="images/Corporations/SOA_Logo_2.659ec1fe.jpg" width="250px"> <p class="enlarge">The Society of Actuaries (SOA) is an educational, research and professional organization dedicated to serving the public and Society members.

To carry out their duties, actuaries must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the business. Accordingly, it is expected that they will attain top executive positions in the company. A very large number of presidents and vice-presidents of Canadian insurance companies have come from the actuarial profession. </p> <p class="indent enlarge"> There are also many actuaries who work in consulting firms where they provide advice on insurance and pensions to a variety of clients including both corporations and labour unions. (This would appeal to the person who is attracted by a private professional practice such as that found in the legal and accounting areas.) </p> <p class="indent enlarge"> A relatively new area is the banking industry and risk management firms, which have recently been hiring actuaries. Other opportunities include employment with governments (both federal and provincial) and teaching and research at universities. </p> <p class="indent enlarge"> There are many rewards for the successful actuary. Salaries are high and compare favourably with other professions. The work is challenging and stimulating. In addition there are the personal benefits that arise from membership in a small and highly respected professional group. </p> <h2>Professional Qualifications</h2> <p class="indent enlarge"> The standard way to qualify as an actuary in Canada is to pass a series of examinations set by either of two main bodies. One is the Society of Actuaries (SOA), which concentrates on life and health insurance, pensions, and investments. The other is the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) which is concerned with property and casualty insurance. </p> <p class="indent enlarge"> University credits are not acceptable in place of the society exams, but university courses can certainly help students to prepare for the exams. However, under the new system, certain approved university courses are validated towards SOA credits. </p> <p class="indent enlarge"> In order to apply to your first entry-level job as an actuary you should have written at least one exam. In practice at least three exams give you better chances of landing your first actuarial job. You should try to have passed three exams by the time you graduate. </p> </section> </div> <div class="col-md-3"> <div class="row"> <h2>Employers:</h2> </div> <div class="row sidebar-box"> <a href="http://www.sunlife.ca/Canada/sunlifeCA/About+us/Careers/Career+opportunitieâ€¦raduate+programs/Co-op+and+summer+internship+opportunities?vgnLocale=en_CA" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/Corporations/Sun-Life-big.64b14f95.png" width="250px"> <p class="enlarge"> Sun Life Financial Inc. is a Canada-based financial services company known primarily as a life insurance company, but also has a strong presence in investment management. </p> </a> </div> <div class="row sidebar-box"> <a href="http://www.manulife.com/public/careers/index/0,,lang=en&navId=660005,00.html" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Corporations/manulife-big-nomotto.f5d2f2d1.png" width="250px"> <p class="enlarge">Manulife Financial Corporation is a Canadian insurance company and financial services provider, with a head office in Toronto, Canada.</p> </a> </div> <div class="row sidebar-box"> <a href="http://www.zurichna.com/zna/careers/internshipprogram.htm" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/Corporations/zurich-small.5e202d0f.jpg" width="250px"> <p class="enlarge">Zurich Insurance Group Ltd is an insurance-based financial services provider.

However, under the new system, certain approved university courses are validated towards SOA credits. <br><br> In order to apply to your first entry-level job as an actuary you should have written at least one exam. In practice at least three exams give you better chances of landing your first actuarial job.<br> You should try to have passed three exams by the time you graduate. </p> </section> </div> <div id="sidebar" class="3u"> <div class="row"> </div> <div class="row"> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

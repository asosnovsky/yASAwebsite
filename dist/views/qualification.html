However, under the new system, certain approved university courses are validated towards SOA credits. </p> <p class="enlarge"> In order to apply to your first entry-level job as an actuary you should have written at least one exam. In practice at least three exams give you better chances of landing your first actuarial job. </p> <p class="enlarge"> You should try to have passed three exams by the time you graduate. </p> </section> </div> <div class="col-md-3 sidebar"> <div class="row"> <h2>Links:</h2> </div> <div class="row sidebar-box"> <a href="http://www.cia-ica.ca/" target="_blank"> <img src="http://www.cia-ica.ca/images/splash/cialogo.png?sfvrsn=2" width="250px"> <p class="enlarge">The Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) is the national organization of the actuarial profession.
